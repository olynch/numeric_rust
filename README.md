# Numeric Rust

This is a repository for me to learn numerical algorithms by implementing them in Rust, and also to learn how to write and benchmark high-performance Rust code.

I'm using both [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) and [gungraun](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun) to benchmark my code.

These algorithms should not be assumed to be correct; use at your own risk!
